        <h4>The Creator!</h4>
        <p><i>Hi! I'm Brooke Springer, I prefer going by my nickname Apricity. I really like drawing and coding, so I decided to combine the two in this program.</i></p>
        <h4>Where did the Swooshy come from?</h4>
        <p><i>The Swooshy was an idea I had in middle school for my theatre class's improv warm-up. The basic idea was you visualized an animal (which didn't have a name at the time) and do something with it, then pass it on to the next person.
        I decided to make a design for the creature, just for fun. It really stuck with me, and now I made this program based off it.</i></p>
